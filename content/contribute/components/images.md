## Example

- A small image: ![a small image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png)

- Images will by default occupy the full width of the reading column, if they are big enough:

  ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png)

- Image size can be set using URL query parameters: ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png?w=100&h=50)

## HTML and Markdown

```markdown
- A small image: ![a small image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png)

- Images will by default occupy the full width of the reading column, if they are big enough:

  ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png)

- Image size can be set using URL query parameters (`h` and `w`): ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png?w=100&h=50)
